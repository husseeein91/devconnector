React-E-Commerce

# Description

This project is a solution for a challenge, which is fetching some products data and visualizing the results in a simple way,
each entity of the data represented a product with some properties, the most concern was on the category, color, price and rating,
as provided is the description of the challenge there will be a filter for each property and the user could combine more than one filter together to get the required item.

My solution for the challenge was focusing on the front-end as there is no login capability so i thought it did not need a back-end development, by using React.js as the front-end library and other packages like axios and redux i was able to complete the challenge.

I did choose those libraries as i wanted to show my experience in using React.js, so the code may be a little complex.

If i am the one building the api for fetching the products i would add a url GET parameters to identify the number of products being fetched, as i believe that it could make more sense rather than handling all the data in the front-end.

I know i could handle this problem in the backend but it will also be additional request to the server as i am getting all the data at once, it also was not this bad as the data where 250 record.

I used MUI react as the ui.

The project was tested after and before deployment.
